# nuclear-fission-ml
I simulated a nuclear chain reaction using Python, then trained a Markov-style ML model to predict neutron counts step-by-step. The plot below shows how closely the ML predictions track the physical simulation. This is how machine learning can approximate stochastic processes in physics...
